# For the publication of "Investigating the impact of aerosol deposition on snowmelt over the Greenland Ice Sheet using 
# a large-ensemble kernel" on ACP (https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2018-542), this repository provides the gridded melt flux 
# perturbations over the Greenland Ice Sheet with varying deposition amount and month. 

# TOTRUNOFFINCREASE_DryBC_4D_12mon_lat_lon_24dryflux_GrIS
# Mean, max and min of annually integrated total runoff increase over the Greenland Ice Sheet resulting from different 
# dry deposition fluxes of BC during different months calculated over 10 1-year simulations 
  
# TOTRUNOFFINCREASE_WetBC_4D_12mon_lat_lon_23wetconc_GrIS
# Mean, max and min of annually integrated total runoff increase over the Greenland Ice Sheet resulting from different 
# concentrations of BC in precipitation deposited during different months calculated over 10 1-year simulations
